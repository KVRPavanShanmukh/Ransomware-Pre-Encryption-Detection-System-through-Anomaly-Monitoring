Working Model:
🎯 What It Does NOT Do (Important):
It does NOT:
Delete files
Modify files
Block system
Access personal data
Upload file contents
It only monitors metadata (rename frequency).



🧠 Detecting the Preparation Stage

Ransomware timeline usually:

Gain access

Disable backup

Start renaming / staging

Begin encrypting

Add ransom note

We intercept at:

➡ Stage 3 (Mass rename spike)
➡ Stage 4 (Rapid modification burst)





1️⃣ What Did We Use for Anomaly Monitoring?

We used behavior-based anomaly detection, not signature-based detection.

That means:

Instead of checking:

“Is this file a known virus?”

We check:

“Is the system behaving abnormally?”

🔍 Our Anomaly Monitoring Techniques
✅ 1. Mass File Rename Detection

Why?

Before encryption completes, ransomware usually:

Renames files rapidly

Adds extensions like .locked, .enc, .crypt

Changes file metadata in bulk

We detect:

More than X renames within Y seconds

Suspicious extensions appearing suddenly

That is behavioral spike detection.

✅ 2. High File Modification Spike

If too many files are modified quickly:

Could indicate encryption process starting

We track modification frequency inside time window

This is rate-based anomaly detection.

✅ 3. Suspicious Extension Monitoring

We check for:

[".locked", ".encrypted", ".crypt", ".enc"]

If those appear → immediate red flag.

This is pattern-based anomaly detection.

✅ 4. Suspicious Process Observation (Optional Layer)

We observe if:

powershell.exe

cmd.exe

unknown executables

are heavily interacting with files.

This is process-behavior correlation.

✅ 5. Event Correlation (Backend Sysmon Simulation)

We simulate:

FileRename

ProcessCreate

NetworkConn

And combine them into alert severity.

This is multi-event correlation detection.

2️⃣ How Did We Detect Pre-Encryption?

Very important.

We detect before full encryption completes by:

🧠 Detecting the Preparation Stage

Ransomware timeline usually:

Gain access

Disable backup

Start renaming / staging

Begin encrypting

Add ransom note

We intercept at:

➡ Stage 3 (Mass rename spike)
➡ Stage 4 (Rapid modification burst)

So instead of detecting encrypted files,
we detect the behavior leading to encryption.

That is pre-encryption detection.

3️⃣ Did We Stop It?

Currently:

We detect and alert.

We do NOT automatically:

Kill processes

Block disk write

Lock filesystem

Right now it is:

Detection + Alerting System

But it can be upgraded to:

Auto process termination

Network isolation

Directory lock

Quarantine mode

4️⃣ What Techniques Did We Technically Use?

Here’s your viva-ready list:

🧠 1. Behavioral Anomaly Detection

Detecting deviations from normal file activity patterns.

🧠 2. Time-Window Threshold Analysis

Using:

if count >= threshold within X seconds:

This is statistical thresholding.

🧠 3. Frequency-Based Heuristic Detection

High frequency of rename/modify = suspicious.

Heuristic-based detection method.

🧠 4. Event Correlation Logic

Combining:

File events

Process events

Extension patterns

To determine severity.

🧠 5. Tokenized Secure Agent Communication

HMAC-based detector token for secure reporting.

This prevents spoofing.

🧠 6. Email Alert + Daily Log Summary

Security event reporting system.

5️⃣ What We DID NOT Use (Be Honest in Viva)

We did NOT use:
Machine Learning
Neural Networks
AI-based clustering
Deep learning models
Real-time kernel drivers
Windows filter drivers
Our system is:
Lightweight behavioral anomaly detection using threshold logic and event correlation.

🎯 One-Line Project Explanation

If someone asks:

“How does your system detect ransomware pre-encryption?”
You say:
Our system detects abnormal file system behavior such as mass renaming and rapid modification
spikes within short time windows, which are strong indicators of ransomware pre-encryption
activity, and immediately alerts the user before full encryption completes.






Future Implementations:

Unique HashValues for each user while logging in.
SOAR implementation
The file will have permissions to stop,block a runnig file.
