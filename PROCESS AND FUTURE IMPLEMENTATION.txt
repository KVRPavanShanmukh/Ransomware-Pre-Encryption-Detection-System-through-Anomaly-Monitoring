Working Model:
🎯 What It Does NOT Do (Important):
It does NOT:
Delete files
Modify files
Block system
Access personal data
Upload file contents
It only monitors metadata (rename frequency).



🧠 Detecting the Preparation Stage

Ransomware timeline usually:
Gain access
Disable backup
Start renaming / staging
Begin encrypting
Add ransom note

We intercept at:
➡ Stage 3 (Mass rename spike)
➡ Stage 4 (Rapid modification burst)




1️⃣ What Did We Use for Anomaly Monitoring?
We used behavior-based anomaly detection, not signature-based detection.

That means:
Instead of checking:
“Is this file a known virus?”
We check:

“Is the system behaving abnormally?”

🔍 Our Anomaly Monitoring Techniques
✅ 1. Mass File Rename Detection

Why?
Before encryption completes, ransomware usually:
Renames files rapidly
Adds extensions like .locked, .enc, .crypt
Changes file metadata in bulk
We detect:
More than X renames within Y seconds
Suspicious extensions appearing suddenly
That is behavioral spike detection.

✅ 2. High File Modification Spike

If too many files are modified quickly:
Could indicate encryption process starting
We track modification frequency inside time window
This is rate-based anomaly detection.

✅ 3. Suspicious Extension Monitoring

We check for:
[".locked", ".encrypted", ".crypt", ".enc"]
If those appear → immediate red flag.
This is pattern-based anomaly detection.

✅ 4. Suspicious Process Observation (Optional Layer)

We observe if:
powershell.exe
cmd.exe
unknown executables
are heavily interacting with files.
This is process-behavior correlation.

✅ 5. Event Correlation (Backend Sysmon Simulation)

We simulate:
FileRename
ProcessCreate
NetworkConn
And combine them into alert severity.
This is multi-event correlation detection.

2️⃣ How Did We Detect Pre-Encryption?

Very important.

We detect before full encryption completes by:
🧠 Detecting the Preparation Stage
Ransomware timeline usually:
Gain access
Disable backup
Start renaming / staging
Begin encrypting
Add ransom note
We intercept at:
➡ Stage 3 (Mass rename spike)
➡ Stage 4 (Rapid modification burst)

So instead of detecting encrypted files,
we detect the behavior leading to encryption.

That is pre-encryption detection.

3️⃣ Did We Stop It?

Currently:
We detect and alert.
We do NOT automatically:
Kill processes
Block disk write
Lock filesystem

Right now it is:
Detection + Alerting System
But it can be upgraded to:
Auto process termination
Network isolation
Directory lock
Quarantine mode





Future Implementations:

Unique HashValues for each user while logging in.
SOAR implementation
The file will have permissions to stop,block a runnig file.
